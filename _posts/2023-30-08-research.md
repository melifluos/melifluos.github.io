## Graph Neural Networks for Link Prediction with Subgraph Sketching

Scaling graph neural networks for link prediction using data sketches, specifically minhash and hyperloglog. As these sketches have permuatation invariant aggregation functions, this can be achieved within the Message Passing Neural Network framework

## Neural sheaf diffusion: A topological perspective on heterophily and oversmoothing in gnns

Applying the power of the sheaf to perform diffusion on graphs. In a nutshell, it's using a small matrix for attention instead of a scalar value on each edge to create a notion of oriented directions.
