## Graph Neural Networks for Link Prediction with Subgraph Sketching

Scaling graph neural networks for link prediction using data sketches, specifically minhash and hyperloglog. As these sketches have permuatation invariant aggregation functions, this can be achieved within the Message Passing Neural Network framework
